    pathmatch: A directory/filename pattern match utility for the Windows command line


    DESCRIPTION

    This is an incomplete collection of source for my pathmatch command line
    utility. It also uses code from a personal library of mine, so I need to
    figure out how I want to package and share this code out. Things will flesh
    out in the future.  -- 2013-March-09


    BUILDING

    This project will not build at this point, since it relies on code from my
    personal library. This is just the seed of the GitHub project for now.
